Pete Connor MS, CCCM",https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecconnor,2024-10-22 13:23:24 UTC,,"Absolutely! As AI solutions continue to grow and expand, the energy demands are going to skyrocket. We're already seeing how AI-driven systems require more computational power, which directly increases energy consumption, especially in server farms. It's not just about the servers themselves, but the cooling systems and fire suppression needed to keep everything running smoothly.  In the next five years, this could become a critical issue if energy demands aren't met with sustainable solutions. If you think about it, we‚Äôre seeing this intersect between the growth of AI and the finite resources available to manage that energy consumption. It‚Äôs conceivable that without innovation in energy-efficient hardware, cooling solutions, or even renewable energy sources, we could face challenges maintaining uptime and efficiency in data centers, which could lead to higher costs or potential downtimes.  And with the rapid increase in electric vehicle production, the strain on the energy grid is going to intensify even more. We‚Äôre already seeing the demand on energy resources grow, and when you add AI's power requirements alongside electric vehicles drawing from the same grid, we could hit a tipping point. It‚Äôs possible that in the near future, we‚Äôll face issues with not having enough energy or physical space to maintain both industries at the scale we‚Äôre expecting.  We might need to seriously explore alternative energy solutions and even rethink how we allocate energy to different sectors. Without forward-thinking planning, the combination of AI and electric vehicle demands could overwhelm our current energy infrastructure, leading to real challenges in balancing growth with sustainability.",INBOX,No,No

Pete Connor MS, CCCM",https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecconnor,2024-10-22 12:45:02 UTC,,"Server farms, also known as data centers, are critical infrastructures that house a large number of servers, enabling organizations to store, process, and manage vast amounts of data. These server farms are designed to handle massive workloads, often supporting a range of services from hospital systems and patient data to business operations and communications. The intense computational power required to operate these servers generates a significant amount of heat, which, if not properly managed, can lead to overheating, component failure, and overall downtime. This is why energy management systems such as cooling and fire suppression are essential components in any server farm.  Cooling systems, such as in-row fans and air conditioning units, are vital for maintaining the optimal operating temperature of servers. These systems ensure that the servers do not overheat, which can cause malfunctions and data loss. Similarly, fire suppression systems are a crucial safeguard to protect both equipment and personnel in case of electrical malfunctions or overheating. A well-designed server farm not only has robust physical security but also implements comprehensive energy management strategies to maintain uptime, prevent catastrophic failures, and ensure data integrity. These systems create a stable environment, allowing for continuous operation even under demanding conditions.  this work?",INBOX,No,No

AI represents an unprecedented leap in automation, something we‚Äôve only seen depicted in science fiction until recently. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, has been the backbone of IT defense for years, embodying the ongoing battle between good and bad actors in the digital realm. My deep interest in cybersecurity has guided my entire career, and I‚Äôve found great fulfillment in safeguarding systems against emerging threats.  While AI is still relatively new to many, I‚Äôve been exploring its potential since its early days. I‚Äôve embraced it for two main reasons: first, to enhance my skills as an IT professional, as I‚Äôm naturally curious about how emerging technologies work; and second, to understand how to defend against malicious actors who seek to exploit AI for harmful purposes. The power of AI is immense, but with that power comes significant responsibility‚Äîboth in how we harness it for good and how we protect it from misuse.  There‚Äôs growing concern that AI will lead to widespread job displacement or even scenarios reminiscent of dystopian films like I, Robot. While the rapid advancement of AI makes such scenarios feel increasingly plausible, cybersecurity will play a crucial role in safeguarding against these potential risks. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that AI can be both a tool for progress and a weapon in the wrong hands. It‚Äôs not just about defending systems against hackers anymore; it's about staying ahead of those who might manipulate AI itself.  AI undoubtedly has a place in our society, offering substantial benefits when used ethically. However, like any powerful technology, it can also be exploited. The phrase, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" rings especially true in this context. Cybersecurity will always be needed, and as AI evolves, so too must the strategies to secure it. This calls for constant vigilance and adaptation within the cybersecurity field. While AI may indeed replace certain jobs, it‚Äôs important to remember that human oversight and intervention are still required to manage and guide these systems effectively.  In the end, it‚Äôs about staying ahead of the curve, not trying to catch up to it. Those who embrace AI while maintaining a solid foundation in cybersecurity will be well-positioned to navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.",INBOX,No,No

They say it never works and very finicky. They would rather use things like zoom over it, but companies love a single provider solution for everything plus they get a huge discount to use all the services versus having a one off thing like zoom.  The reason I bring this up is because you need to have a strong network to support that cloud environment. If teams is messing up on that network and you went to the cloud service, that cloud service might have the same kind of issues too. Just something to think about.  If the network is fine, then yes I see CCAAS being a solution for it's scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration if they have other cloud solutions in place.",INBOX,No,No

If you‚Äôre having a similar experience to other people nowadays, you‚Äôve noticed that applying to jobs online just isn‚Äôt working as well anymore.   You might already know this - around 1% of online job applications lead to an interview.   But here's the silver lining: people still land jobs they love every day. The key is to adapt to a new playbook, one that's proven to be effective in today's job market.   Can I send you our full playbook to see if it could help?

Pete Connor MS, CCCM",https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecconnor,2024-10-18 19:34:06 UTC,,"C. Pete,  Thank you for inviting me to connect. I very much appreciate you.  Even though we are now first connections, if you would like to read my posts and articles, please click the bell icon on my LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn will, then, alert you of my posts and articles via your ""Notifications"" feed.   Unfortunately, I suffered a stroke in April 2021. So, I have slurred speech and a dead right side. I hope to recover sometime soon, ideally by early 2025.  Since my stroke, I‚Äôve gone from Mr. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be GREAT out there!‚Äù as GM/Managing Director to Mr. Invisible sequestered with my wife in my San Diego apartment. While we may not have any real-time verbal or written conversations, I am happy we connected.  Since I am handicapped with only one hand, I have a cellphone ONLY for my family. So I do not communicate via ZOOM, WhatsApp, text messages, telegraph, or telephone conversations with you or any other business professionals.  As a backstory, I started in 1976 at Marriott‚Äôs GREAT AMERICA Theme Park. After several years, I joined Marriott Hotels at Marriott‚Äôs Rancho Las Palmas Resort. I have been in hospitality ever since. From 1999 until March 2021, I was a GM/Managing Director of destination full-service/luxury hotels or resorts. There was no such thing as CX, but I was doing more than serving to satisfy guests. I wanted guests to have a ‚Äúbetter than the average‚Äù experience that guests expected. So I served to WOW them. I served to CARE (Communicate. Acknowledge. Respond. Enrich). And I would end every department‚Äôs daily stand-up and weekly meetings with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be GREAT out there!‚Äù In between day-to-day responsibilities, I was a customer service speaker and, from 2006-2010, an adjunct instructor for the local community college. In college, I taught customer service to office administration, nursing assistants, and retail students required to attend the course.  I was an on-call CX speaker from 2001 until last March. When I retired, I planned to be a speaker. Then everything went south. So, I was hoping for my comeback. Whenever I fully recover, I hope to have some semblance of visibility to potential business leaders. And since I have nothing to do except rehab, I only connect on LinkedIn. Since no one emails me often enough, if at all, I can post and comment on LI a lot, but it takes time to complete a single thought. In this case, this message was a copy and paste of my history from serving as GM until right now.    As an addendum, as a stroke survivor, I certainly am not a medically educated healthcare leader. Having gone through the ordeal of physician and physical therapist appointments and meetings, I am a patient care advocate. As a patient, I feel emotional remuneration is just as important to a patient‚Äôs well-being as physical remuneration is to their health. Whether healthcare professionals know it or not, patients seek the best emotional value in their experience, not just a remedy to their physical ailments.  Enough about me. I look forward to learning more about you, what you do, and your insights.  Ever since my stroke, I have lost the ""busyness"" of business. Rather than lamenting that ""such is life"", I vow to do better. Mark Sanborn has said, ""You don't need a title to be a leader"". Rather than listening to my ""WII-FM"" mental radio station, ""What's in it for me?"", I aspire to be a servant leader to enthuse, encourage, and empower others to develop themselves and engage others.  So, ""What can I do to help you?‚Äù",INBOX,No,No

Pete Connor MS, CCCM",https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecconnor,2024-09-26 14:19:42 UTC,,"Subject: Response to Settlement Inquiry - Lack of Receipts and Excessive Claim  Dear Mr. Grovas,  I have received your email regarding the lawsuit filed by Person B. While I am open to discussing settlement options, I have serious concerns about the validity and amount of the claim being made.  First, Person B initially claimed $3,000 in damages but has now filed a lawsuit for $8,000. No receipts, repair estimates, or other supporting documentation have been provided to substantiate even the original $3,000 claim. Without proper documentation, I am unable to verify the legitimacy of the claimed damages.  Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194.2, a party may request disclosure of ""the amount and any method of calculating economic damages,"" which requires Person B to provide sufficient evidence to support the claimed damages. To date, no such evidence has been presented. I would therefore request that Person B provide the relevant documents and receipts to substantiate the damages before any further settlement discussions occur.  Additionally, I believe this lawsuit could potentially fall under the definition of frivolous litigation. According to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.001, claims must be based on reasonable factual evidence. Filing a lawsuit without supporting documentation could result in sanctions under Section 10.004, including dismissal of the lawsuit and an award of attorney‚Äôs fees for defending against a baseless claim.  Furthermore, I would like to remind you that Texas law requires a good faith basis for the amount of damages claimed. If Person B cannot provide evidence for the current $8,000 demand, it could be construed as an attempt to inflate damages and pressure me into an unjustified settlement.  Should Person B fail to provide the necessary documentation to support their claim, I am prepared to pursue all legal remedies, including filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit or seeking sanctions for filing a frivolous suit.  I encourage Person B to provide the documentation so that we may evaluate the claim and determine if an amicable resolution can be reached. Otherwise, I will proceed with the defense of this case, including filing appropriate motions to challenge the unsupported claim.  Thank you for your time and cooperation.  Sincerely",INBOX,No,No

We think the same!¬† I really believe the real opportunity is helping contact centers embed AI solutions into their overall operational strategy. Before deploying any new technology we should start by helping them to¬† clarify ""what is the problem they are trying to solve?"" and then do a gap analysis of people, processes and technology to close the gap between current and future state. I offer a three week gap analysis to my clients to ensure the technology is aligned with the people and processes. Too often, technology implementations skips this important step and simply rushes to deploy new automation and AI solutions. They will never realize the intended results without alignment and leadership's ability to effectively¬† manage change. I'd love to collaborate with you, I think we make a powerhouse team.

It gives good tips on how to make sales calls without sounding fake or pushy.   You explained things clearly and gave some good examples of what to say, which is helpful. You did a good job making cold calling seem less scary and more like a skill you can get better at with practice.   However, the article could be even better if it talked about how cold calling fits in with stuff like social media marketing, or how to deal with rejection when people aren't interested.   It'd also be cool if they included some numbers to show why cold calling still works, and maybe some advice on how to tell if you're getting better at it over time.   Overall, it's a useful guide for anyone starting out in sales, but there's room to make it even more helpful.  One other thing, I'd recommend using more of your own language, AI is great but you can add a piece of you in there too!¬†  Great job Peter!",INBOX,No,No

Have you ever considered owning your own business?  I ask because we help busy professionals do this every day by finding franchises that suit their skill sets (I swear we do this for a living).  That way folks can either have a ""manager-run"" franchise and keep their day job OR run something full time and exit corporate America.  Would you be interested in learning more?

Beyond the standard quality control offered by most other vendors, we also provide advanced predictive machine learning and AI for lead qualification, real-time agent training/agent assists BOTs, all at a surprisingly low price in the marketplace, and can support and scale small call centers of 30+ agents, or those with 10,000+ agents.  Yactraq supports more than 40 languages. We also whitelabel our product and can deploy anywhere, with truly a larger feature set than our competitors at a dramatically lower cost (often more than 50% less than others).  Would it be worth 30 minutes of your time to see how we can mutually benefit from each other?  Please let us know your thoughts.  Thanks and Regards, Triveni triveni@yactraq.com",INBOX,No,No

TCN is pretty much everything for a call center in the cloud, TCPA dialing, outbound dialer, ringless drop, SMS, email, call recording, soft phone, inbound, built in compliance, big data analytics, speech analytics, human initiator or manually approved dialing, WFO, WFM etc.  Let me know and I can schedule a 20-minute demo.   Our price model is straight, no long-term contracts, no monthly minimum, no start-up costs only a minute charge.  Also, have a very nice integration, which can reduce manger workload by 30-40%, with Finvi, CUBS, Balto, Quantrax, Interprose, Salesforce, Debtnet and many other CRMs.  Notable customers include NCO, Ebay, ADP, Experian, Hilton Grand Vacations, Allied International, First Citizens, Old National Bank, Windham, iQor and Gannet Newspapers.  Setup takes less than a day to have a call center up and operating.  Thanks again  Nathan www.tcn.com",INBOX,No,No

As part of this initiative, we‚Äôre creating a panel of engaged hiring decision-makers in small to medium businesses who would be eager and willing to give feedback in the form of surveys and interviews/focus groups. This will enable our team to get feedback from you, their target users, in order to make data-driven decisions.   There will be continuous opportunities to be compensated for sharing your valuable opinions; this is not a one-time opportunity. Once you are on the panel, we host monthly online 5-minute surveys (typical compensation is $20-$25) as well as conducting research studies throughout the year (typical compensation is $200 for 60-minute IDIs).    If you are interested in being part of this panel, please answer the questions in the brief qualifying survey and a member of our team will be in touch to schedule your interview should you qualify.  https://survey.FocusInsite.com/zs/78B3ap  We are members of the Market Research Association and there is absolutely no sales component with any of our studies.

I've been interviewing contact/call center leaders about best practices (people, process and technology) and then writing articles on our conversation. Here are the basics on the project:  1. It will take between 30-60 minutes and I promise to be respectful of your time. 2. I only use your name or your company if you give me the OK.  3. I will send you the article before I post it for any feedback and/or approval.  4. If you allow me to use your name and/or company I will promote it on your behalf.  5. The content could be based on your current company or just overall experience in the CX space.  My long term goal is to organize the content and write a book on my findings...  Would you be open to this conversation? We could meet over Teams/Zoom and I would give you an Amazon gift card for your time...  Let me know when you get a chance.  EJ",INBOX,No,No

I am an executive recruiter retained by SimpleTire LLC, an online marketplace with a virtual inventory model that facilitates web-based tire sales.  The company has recently been purchased by Bain Capital and is in rapid-growth mode.    SimpleTire has a unique business model offering the best prices on new tires for every vehicle and a simple buying experience while supporting local businesses. Unlike traditional retail models, SimpleTire does not own inventory but uses data and technology to source tire inventory for every type of vehicle from their network of suppliers.   SimpleTire has grown over 200% for each of the past three years.    We are seeking a Vice President of Customer Sales and Service to join our leadership team.  In this role you would lead the SimpleTire Sales service strategy, operational excellence, and ensure an exceptional level of customer service experience pre and post purchase support to our customers across shopping channels through leading the call, chat and email support team.  This leader will build and support a best-in-class, high performing sales, customer support and service team committed to continuously improve KPI's, customer satisfaction metrics, engagement and retention, achieving sales and service goals.    While the call center operation is currently quite small (approx. 50 remote employees), this is an opportunity to build an inbound and outbound state-of-the-art function on a blank canvas in a rapidly growing company.    In light of your experience, I would love an opportunity connect.  Perhaps there are people within your network you might suggest for this role.   While the SimpleTire headquarters are in Trevose, PA, this role can be fully remote.  I would welcome sharing the Job Description with you.

I don't want to bore you with a lot of texts but I'll put it in context.

Pete, this allows you to train faster, reduce onboarding, nesting, tier 2 escalations, and time to proficiency by 50%. We have over 12k agents at Wyndham, about 7k at Blue Cross, and a lot of organizations deploying PF to their contact centers.  for further context, this video explains our solution better: https://procedureflow.com/industries/contact-center  Can we schedule a call for next week, I'll come with my time for a quick 10 minutes.

Nobelbiz has taken off our ‚ÄúSales Hats‚Äù and have put on our ‚ÄúHumanitarian Hats‚Äù during COVID-19, and is in a position to offer our Omni+ Cloud Contact Center Software solution FOR FREE to those Companies who need their agents to be able to work remotely, who now need better security & better remote agent monitoring, and who have 30+ total agents!  I‚Äôm sure your company has already migrated your call center agents from a physical call center (s) to remote home locations. But, are you now exploring other, better, more secure ways for your remote agents to interact with your prospects, or customers?  - Nobelbiz will waive its $85+ monthly fee per license duration for the next 6 months during this pandemic! Example: If you have 1,000 agents, that‚Äôs $85,000/month in savings x 6 months = $510,000 total savings! If you have 5,000 agents using our free offer, you will save $2,550,000 over 6 months!   The only cost to the business is for the usage per minute fees at their normal rates (we are not increasing the usage fees in a way to profit from this) and any MRCs related to numbers etc.   - Our Cloud solution allows for agents to log in remote anywhere they have an internet connection, PC, and headset. Being an Omni capable solution companies can continue to communicate via Voice, Web chat, SMS, Email, and Social Media  - We are offering an out of the box FastTrack solution that can be deployed in 72 hours, based on requirements, with no minimum spend, no long-term contracts, no set up and training fees.  - Companies may cancel at any time, without any penalties!  What is the catch? There is None!  We know companies are hurting right now and the requirement to work from home is creating havoc in our industry. We want to do what we can to help our friends and be supportive to our industry through this unprecedented time.   Even if you just want to review what you are doing or end up needing something we do not offer we have been making recommendations and referring companies to other providers or types of solutions that better meet your needs.  If your company needs your call center agents to work remotely, if you are just not happy with your current remote platform, or if you know of another call center who needs the software to allow their call center agents to work remotely, then please let me know, since it‚Äôs free!

With  calls likely spiking over the next 6+ weeks, I can imagine you foreseeing a larger requirement for interpretation services in your operations for non-English speakers.  TransPerfect can help manage that volume more efficiently with lower ASA and AHT to get your English agents available for the next calls more quickly.   A few data points on TransPerfect‚Äôs operations: ‚Ä¢	Expected minimal impact ‚Äì Given the ability and training for much of our staff to WAH if needed, we expect minimal affects to system capacity ‚Ä¢	Strong Staffing ‚Äì Our Ops team has been proactive in supporting a projected volume increase over the last several weeks, so we have generous capacity from a staffing perspective ‚Ä¢	Strong pipeline ‚Äì With many organizations pushing hourly staff away, we are doing to opposite and bringing on more resources. Our pipeline for support will continue to grow  While I hope there are no issues in your current system, if you would like to discuss TransPerfect as a redundant/alternative option to your over-the-phone interpretation solution, please let me know.

Pete,   My name is Helen Gao and I am an Associate with EY-Parthenon, a market research and strategy consulting firm. My team recently started a study on the pre-answer phone authentication space. We are interested in learning about key purchasing criteria for providers in the space (such as Nuance, TrustID, Pindrop, etc.), why companies would use the technology, and how different providers perform across key criteria.  We are looking to interview people involved in the decision-making process for choosing a contact center authentication technology, and it seems likes you have the experience and background that we are seeking for this project. Our hope is to have a 30 minute phone call with you sometime in the next few days (9/6-9/7 and 9/10-9/12). For your time, we can compensate you with a $200 Tango gift card that can be used at a variety of online and brick-and-mortar retailers including Amazon, iTunes, and Target.  If you have a colleague better suited for this discussion, feel free to pass along my information to them, and please note that all information will remain anonymous and only used in aggregate as part of our third-party market study.  I look forward to speaking with you soon! Thanks,  Helen   Associate | Parthenon-EY http://parthenon.ey.com/po/en/home",INBOX,No,No

Our client needs a real heavyweight who has extensive experience in CRM.   The successful candidate will manage the 30, major fortune 100 accounts throughout the whole United States.  And they only have to have someone that has extensive, documentable success selling CRM (pricing, procurement, supply-chain, etc.) into major CPG accounts. Although the OTE is only $250,000, the three other national account managers in this job earn well north of $500,000. This opportunity is for a CRM specialist who loves their present job but maybe isn‚Äôt competing in the 'big leagues' or needs to earn $1 million and simply can't were they are. It is a killer job, but requires a track record in CRM to CPG. Exact experience is NECESSARY (they have a handful of quality internal candidates...but those candidates don't have the CRM/CPG experience...so they won't hire somone who can do the job...they already have that... they need exact experience!)      PROJECT CONSULTING Our BI software client needs a Sr. Service Sales person. This person is the ONLY service sales rep. in the region. NO COLD CALLING. The successful candidate will sell to the PRESENT clients...and there are TONS of them...the company is very, very established. They need to find someone who has sold consulting services for a software vendor. This experience is an absolute MUST. The candidate will do SOW's, architect the solutions, etc. The person needs to be very entrepreneurial in being able to contact the clients and come up with solutions to help them.  Five to ten years of selling consulting services for a software vendor is necessary.  The successful candidate needs to prove that they have ""done it before.""  Having ""done it before"" means that the service salesperson has to book 100 to 200 installed accounts of the software vendor...they pick up the phone and call those accounts  and find their  'pain' for  implementation, upgrade or new development initiatives...they then scope the project out, develop the proposal, sell the proposal, and staff the proposal. It is like managing one‚Äôs own consulting division within a large company. Selling consulting projects for an EXTERNAL third party consulting firm does NOT qualify ...there has to be experience selling consulting services for a software vendor somewhere in the successful candidate's background. $225,000 on quota     TALENT MANAGEMENT and E-LEARNING SOFTWARE these guys are really hot car rate they grew 48% last year and will do the same next year.  They have an absolutely sweet territory of Dallas and North Texas that is in excellent shape.   They need to hire a candidate and have them start within the next two weeks.  They require experience either selling talent management or online learning. $200,000 on a low quota.         WE STILL NEED 3 OR 4 LIGHTLY EXPERIENCED TECHNOLOGY SALES PEOPLE ...Just plain A-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E, meat eating hunters who have sold telephone systems, payroll processing etc....any high activity, strong, one or two call close type of sales qualifies. The opportunities we have are in consultative software, services and other technologies. Bases range anywhere from $65,000 to $80,000 with OTE's of $120,000 to $170,000.",INBOX,No,No

Fortunately, I don't seek or need your opinion so I'm not concerned about your conclusions as to my motivations. Since it doesn't hurt you at all, I'd suggest not worrying about it further and moving on before this becomes more unhealthy for you than it appears to have become.

You had a so so experience with a Jr Recruiter who is no longer with my agency. I have tried repeatedly to speak with you about this and do whatever I can to make it right but it seems that your motives for rating businesses 1 star isn't to shine light on how they can improve, but to cause harm with no interest in being a part of the solution so that these businesses can improve their customer experience.   I have built my business and worked very hard to create the reputation that I have. Your review isn't hurting me in anyway.  It's the principle of it.   I have reviewed every one of your Google Reviews and 99% of them are 1 star reviews complaining about the smallest thing.   Please consider doing the right thing and taking this false review down.

Would you be willing to remove your 1 star review from my Google Business page? Your feedback was heard and as a result, I made a change in my business to avoid this kind of candidate experience in the future. I have increased the depth and length of training with new recruiters before they interview candidates. Ultimately, all candidates are interviewed by me. Unfortunately, since the position you were being interviewed for was cancelled, I never had the pleasure of speaking with you.   You also stated in your comment that you weren't sure there was a client or real position. After you remove the 1 star, I'm more than happy to disclose who our client was. We never filled the position. Since it was the beginning of the new year, budget cuts impacted headcount and the position was cancelled.
